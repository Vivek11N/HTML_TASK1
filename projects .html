            <li><h3>Temperature controlled fan</h3></li>
            <p>The temperature-controlled fan circuit utilizing the LM741 operational amplifier maintains a desired temperature level by comparing the ambient temperature measured by a sensor with a reference voltage. The Op-Amp adjusts its output voltage based on this comparison, which in turn modulates the fan speed through control logic circuitry, ensuring efficient thermal management. While offering automatic temperature regulation without manual intervention, this circuit demands careful consideration of component specifications and the limitations of the LM741 Op-Amp. Despite these considerations, it provides a straightforward solution for various applications requiring precise temperature control.</p>
            <li><h3>Quiz Buzzer</h3></div></li>
            <p>The quiz buzzer circuit based on the 8051 microcontroller facilitates interactive quiz sessions by enabling participants to buzz in with responses. Utilizing the 8051 microcontroller, the circuit manages participant inputs, determines the order of responses, and regulates buzzer activation accordingly. Participants trigger their responses through dedicated input mechanisms, with the microcontroller managing response queues and activating the buzzer for the first participant to signal readiness. Designed for simplicity and reliability, this circuit enhances engagement and interactivity in quiz environments, while leveraging the capabilities of the 8051 microcontroller for efficient operation.</p>
